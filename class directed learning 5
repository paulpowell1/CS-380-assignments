A Helper Function
Exercise 253 on page 161 shows a recursive definition of nCk. Here's a much more efficient way to compute binomial coefficients, which perhaps you can profitably use in your investigations:

In [1]:
from math import gcd

def nCk(n, k):
  if k < 0 or k > n:
    return 0
  else:
    result = 1
    d = 1
    g = 1
    m = min(k, n - k)
    while (d <= m):
      g = gcd(result, d)
      result = n * (result // g)
      result = (result // (d // g))
      n -= 1
      d += 1
    return result
Predominant and Fundamental
The predominant pattern, the fundamental symmetry in Pascal's triangle is captured by the identity:$${n \choose k} = {n \choose n - k}$$

Identify Identities
Here are two different identities that point out the same pattern in Pascal's triangle. What is the name of this pattern?

Identity 1
For nonnegative integers $r$ and $n$:$$\sum^n_{k=0} {r+k \choose k} = {r+n+1 \choose n}$$

Identity 2
For nonnegative integers $m$ and $n$:$$\sum^n_{k=0} {k \choose m} = {n+1 \choose m+1}$$


Investigate A Possible Relationship
Does any row in Pascal's Triangle have the Fibonacci numbers' relationship between three consecutive entries? In other words, where x, y, and z are three consecutive entries in a single row, does x + y = z?

The number of rows where this relationship could possibly hold is:

[ ] Zero.
[ ] At least one.
[ ] At most one.
[x] Exactly one.
[ ] It cannot be determined.
Investigate Another Possible Relationship
Does any row in Pascal's Triangle have three consecutive entries in the ratio 1:2:3? (12:24:36 is an example of three numbers in a 1:2:3 ratio.)?

The number of rows where this relationship could possibly hold is:

[ ] Zero.
[ ] At least one.
[x] At most one.
[ ] Exactly one.
[ ] It cannot be determined.
